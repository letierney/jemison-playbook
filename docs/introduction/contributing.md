## About the playbook
The playbook is made using Docusaurus and GitHub this means that anyone in Jemison can contribute. We encourage everyone in the club to contribute as this will always be a work in progress.

It's really hard to break things as your changes will be peer reviewed which will help find any bugs or errors. If you have any suggestions on articles we could add or improvements to the information architecture we could make, then please post these in the [jemison-playbook](https://and-jemison.slack.com/archives/C02CEJ7JP40) channel on slack.

### Getting a GtiHub account
You need a GitHub account to be able to contribute to the Playbook. Visit Github to sign up for an account. You can use your AND email address or sign in with a personal account.

### Accessing the repo
Everyone at AND with a GiHub account can access to download and suggest edits to the playbook. If you have just made a GitHub account then post in the the [jemison-playbook](https://and-jemison.slack.com/archives/C02CEJ7JP40) channel on slack and someone will be able to help.

You can find the playbook repo here.

## How to suggest edits
There are three ways to suggest edits to the playbook.

1. Directly from the playbook article
2. Using an online code editor
3. Using a code editor on your computer

All ways will allow you to edit the playbook. Editing on your computer will allow you to see changes before they are merged and deployed to the live site but if you are new to GitLab then you may find it easier to edit the playbook online.
