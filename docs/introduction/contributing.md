## How the playbook is built
The playbook is made using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and GitHub so anyone in Jemison can view and contribute. We encourage everyone in the club to contribute as this will always be a work in progress.

It's really hard to break things as your changes will be peer reviewed to help find any bugs or errors. If you have any suggestions on pages or sections we could add, or improvements to the information architecture we could make, then please post these in the [jemison-playbook](https://and-jemison.slack.com/archives/C02CEJ7JP40) channel on slack.

### Creating a GitHub account
You need a GitHub account to be able to contribute to the Playbook. Visit [Github](https://github.com/) to sign up for an account. You can use your AND email address or sign in with a personal account. The repo is open source (publicly accessible) and stored in the AND Digital Jemison organisation.

### Accessing the repo
If you have just made a GitHub account then post in the the [jemison-playbook](https://and-jemison.slack.com/archives/C02CEJ7JP40) channel on slack and someone will be able to help and make sure you're added to the right organisations and groups. If you're not added to the right repositories then you won't be able to contribute to the playbook so this step's super important!

You can find the playbook [repo here](https://github.com/AND-Digital-Jemison/jemison-playbook).

## How to suggest edits as a pull request
There are three ways to suggest edits to the playbook.

1. Directly from the playbook page
2. Using an online code editor
3. Using a code editor on your computer

Editing on your computer will allow you to preview changes before they are pulled and deployed to the live site via localhost. If you are new to GitHub then you may find it easier to edit the playbook online to start with.

Remember to follow [these guidelines](https://jemison-playbook.netlify.app/#guidelines-for-pages) if you are editing an existing pages or creating something new.

### Editing from a playbook page

5. Make your change
6. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
7. Add a description to explain what the changes are about then click Create pull request. Without this information your pull request may be rejected.
8. Add in a name for the target branch such as update-to-about-playbook. GitHub will show a tick box that will start a new pull request. We want this box to be ticked, so that your changes can be reviewed and applied.
9. Click Propose Changes.
10. Copy the URL of the pull request and paste it in the [jemison-playbook](https://and-jemison.slack.com/archives/C02CEJ7JP40) channel on slack tagging Carissa in your post. The URL should look like xxxxx.

### Editing using a code editor on your computer
You may want to ask a developer for help with this if you haven't done this before. Ask in the [jemison-playbook](https://and-jemison.slack.com/archives/C02CEJ7JP40) channel on slack and someone'll be able to give you a hand!
