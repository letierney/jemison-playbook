# The Jemison Playbook

## The playbook
The Jemison playbook is intended as a one stop shop for all information you might need as a Jemison ANDi!

It is a place to house documentation, links, and information on processes. Because this has been built as an [open source project](https://jemison-playbook.netlify.app/introduction/contributing), all Jemison ANDis can contribute, but we do need to be careful on what we post and advertise on here as this can be seen by anyone, including people outside of the organisation. This is unlikely, but possible.

To mitigate this risk we have created the [following guidelines](https://jemison-playbook.netlify.app/#guidelines-for-articles) which should be adhered to as much as possible.

## How to get involved
The Jemison playbook needs you! To make this a success, we all need to play a part in adding and maintaining the playbook as information changes. 

### Guidelines for articles
#### Context is key
Provide context for the article before launching straight in with information. This is super important to help signpost people to know they're in the right place to answer their question.

#### Links and examples
Link to other resources and examples where possible as these are more likely to be kept up to date. Doing this also means that more sensitive information will be accessed behind Single Sign On access. 

#### Duplication and upkeep
We want to minimise duplication of effort and information. Alongside including links to other resources which are more likely to be kept up to date (google slide decks, information in slack channels etc.), this means checking that there is not another suitable article to add information to before starting one afresh. 

#### Structure and hierarchy
Think about the placement of your article or information - we want to ensure that it is easy to find and in a logical place. Before 'going live' we have conducted information architecture assessments and sessions to make sure that the content of the playbook supports usability and findability.

## Feedback and questions
We've created the [jemison-playbook](https://and-jemison.slack.com/archives/C02CEJ7JP40) slack channel to answer any questions and address any feedback you have on the playbook. This can range from 'I think this would be better written as *xxx*', 'I wonder if the information would be more findable in *xxx*', or 'I think *xxx* is missing!'
