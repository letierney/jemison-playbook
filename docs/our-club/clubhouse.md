The clubhouse is our space to come together and collaborate on work as Jemison ANDis, as well as to see some friendly faces! Our office is part of a larger building and coworking space which is shared with other companies too. 

## Where is the clubhouse?
Our club is located in central manchester in Bloc, 17 Marble Street, Manchester. In the same building are [Trove](https://www.trovefoods.co.uk/) and [Reset by Form](https://formmcr.com/reset/). Our office is located on the first floor - for more specific instructions on navigating the building please [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bltwC0PEA5I0KxgKgg_QSFXX1itGvy6m/view).

## How do I get in?
Every ANDi will be allocated an access card. If you forget your pass, you can borrow a temporary one for the day from the Bloc reception, but any lost passes will incure a personal charge of Â£25.

Before you visit the office you need to register yourself for a space using the [reginald app via slack](https://slack.com/app_redirect?app=A016ZJ74JE6). This is so that we can monitor and measure office usage as we scale, and so we know who may have been in contact in case of a covid outbreak.
