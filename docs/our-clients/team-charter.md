## What is a team charter?
A team charter is a series of living artefacts created by a team that clarifies a team's direction, purpose, scope, boundaries, and operating guidelines.

If you've ever worked on a team where your perception of a goal was slightly different from your teammates', then you'll know how frustrating that can be! A team charter aligns everyone's visions and captures all ideas of what the team can and shold strive to be and achieve.

## Why do we have a template at Jemison?
We have created a [series of templates](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lFGyZUQ=/) which can be used by Jemison ANDis on any piece of work (be that internal or on client side) to help bring some structure to this process without being totally prescriptive. They are here as some ideas for exercises, starting points, and leading questions to achieve useful outcomes.

## How do I use this?
[The templates (and guidelines) are housed on miro.](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lFGyZUQ=/) This is for ease of displaying the information, though these might move depending on our tooling capabilities going forwards and this page will be updated accordingly.

If you wish to run some Team Charter exercises as a team then you will need to do the following:
1. Create a new space (miro or otherwise) where you want to collaborate on this as a team. (Or repurpose one you already have)
2. Navigate to the [Team Charter - Jemison miro page](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lFGyZUQ=/)
3. Duplicate the templates you want to use (or the whole board if that's easier)
4. Paste these in your new workspace and off you go!

#### Callouts and Warnings:
- Please do not edit the template directly. This makes it really tricky for other people to user in the future.
- The nature of our tooling setup at AND right now limits the number of free boards, spaces, and teams we can create on miro. Be savvy with how you use boards and try to use for more than one purpose in a single team if possible.
