## What is Elapseit?
[Elapseit](https://elapseit.com/) is the tool chosen by AND to track and approve our billable time, holidays, sick days, training days, and expenses. Each ANDi is accountable for the accuracy of the data they enter into Elapseit. 

## Timesheets
[Timesheets](https://app.elapseit.com/timesheet) are a way to record and keep track of your worked time. In AND terms, these are important so that we can monitor our club utilisation and bill clients accordingly. Only billable ANDis (people who work directly on a client) need to complete timesheets in Elapseit. 

We need to complete these weekly so that we can provide accurate invoices to clients. It is critical that we bill our time accurately and on provide these invoices in a timely fashion to clients to manage our P&L. Even if we're not on a client right now, we should be charging our time to the Jemison - Ground Control project code.

If you'd like to see the process of submitting a timesheet in action, here's a [handy video tutorial](https://vimeo.com/338124066).

### How do I submit a timesheet?
1. Log into Elapseit
2. Click on 'Timesheet' from the Navbar
3. Every friday, confirm the days you have worked and the project code this time is assigned to (this should total 8 hour days per day)
4. Every third friday of the month, confirm the total days worked in that billing period. This is when the service team preps and sends out invoices so all information provided needs to be accurate.

Your timesheet also links to approved holiday, sick leave, and training days, so it's important that these are kept up-to-date too.

#### Add new row button
If no project codes are showing on your timesheet, you may need to search for them and add these manually. You can do this by 'adding a new row'. This is most likely if you are on Ground Control. If you have any questions about adding a new row or project code, contact the service team first.

#### Copy from last week button
If your billable hours and project code is the same as the previous week, you can use this function to copy your hours over to the week you are inputting.

### What if I have an issue with completing my timesheet?
If you have an issue completing your timesheet, the first point of contact will be the service team. They are responsible for allocation to the right project codes in Elapseit and should be able to help if you have an issue with time codes and timesheet submission.


## Leave Requests
[Leave requests](https://app.elapseit.com/leave) of any kind need to be tracked and approved in Elapseit. As they tie into timesheets and invoicing, it's important that leave requests are accurate. You can check how many holiday, training and innovation days you have remaining on Elapseit too!

## Expenses
Claiming [expenses](https://app.elapseit.com/financial/expenses/list) is a way of being reimbursed for things that you have paid out of pocket for which can be recouped by AND. Expenses must be submitted within 60 days of the purchase. If you have any questions on what a suitable expense may or may not be, ask the People Lead (if club related) or your Service Delivery Manager (if client related). 

If you'd like to see the process of submitting an expense in action, here's a [handy video tutorial](https://vimeo.com/338127093).


### How do I submit an expense?
If you have any questions on what expense type or project code you need to use, contact your line manager and/or Service Delivery Manager for clarification before submitting your expense.

1. Log into Elapseit
2. Click on 'Financial' from the Navbar
3. Click on the '+' symbol in the bottom right hand corner of the screen to add an expense request
4. Add the details of the 'Person' this expense is for. This is because there are different expense rules for different business units.
5. Add an expense name (a brief description of what you are claiming for)
6. Pick the expense type (examples: Home Working Equipment, Office Supplies, Travel)
7. Add the expense amount. This is always in GBP.
8. Pick the project code (example: AND - Jemison - Expenses)

10. Attach a detailed VAT invoice/receipt. Credit card payment slips will not be included.
11. Submit your expense claim
11. Notify your line manager that you have submitted an expense claim. They do not receive a notification for this so it is your responsibity to inform them.

After you've submitted your expense, it goes to your line manager and/or finance team for approval. Once approved, you will be reimbursed. If rejected, you will need to amend and resubmit your expense claim for approval.

### When do expenses get paid?
Expenses are reimbursed every other Friday - you can see when these are on [this calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=and.digital_ssoka3fqojc6bc4a00f770o8t4@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London). Only expenses which have been approved (by line managers and finance if applicable) by 12pm on the Wednesday of that week will be included in the payment run.
