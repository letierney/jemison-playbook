## What is a bio?
We use bios to help present our skills and experience in a uniform way across the teams. They are used as part of the scheduling and client onboarding processes to help understand who the best fit for a role might be alongside understanding our own preferences and career development plans.

## What to include
When you join AND you will be given a bio to complete and template for filling this in by your Squad Lead. (Don't be alarmed if this might look a bit different to others in your Squad as there are two templates floating about!) There are a few areas in particular you will need to focus on, no matter which template you choose to follow.

Carissa: do you know if there is a drive to move to one template version eventually or is there a choice?

#### Overview
Who are you!? This is your 'elevator pitch' and opportunity to highlight your experience and how awesome you are!

#### Core Focus
What drives you and where is your focus area?

#### Key Skills
If someone asked you what your top 3-5 work-related superpowers were, what would you say?

#### Experience Highlights
Here you should highlight three of your areas of experience. These can relate to opportunites you've had whilst you've worked on clients with AND, previous employers, or projects/internships/trainings you've completed previously. Use this area to give a brief overview of your duties and your key achievements.

#### Key Clients
This doesn't have to be just at AND, but who and where have you worked in the past?

#### Industry Experience
Which industries have you worked in and had exposure to?

#### Tech Stack
What technology do you feel most comfortable using? This can cover langauges, frameworks, and tools.

## When to update your bio
You should update your bio everytime you complete a significant piece of work which you would want showcased to a potential client. Emphasise the areas you worked on, things you enjoyed, and things you learnt. It's important to keep your bio up to date so that it best reflects you to help the Ops Team to help you get the right experience and opportunities that'll be the best fit for you.
